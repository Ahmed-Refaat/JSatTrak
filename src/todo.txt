ideas to maybe work on (x=done)

Version 1.0
------------------
x Sat settings dialog (2d settings.. etc) 
x add name showing to 2D plot (name of sat)
x open TLE sat broswer with data from web directly (for web start?) option
x 2D window zoom capibility
x Help about window (copy from SA analyzer)
x Update TLE dialog, progress indecator, proxy settings
x Update TLE - propogate updates to exsiting sats in scene
x Sat browswer convert to Internatl Frame
x Add overall sim options (such as refresh rates, etc)
x Add options for each 2D window, zoom increment, print current time on each, bgcolor
x Screen shot capibility
x Save/Open ability
x Web page / java webstart
x icon logo

Make progressbarworker (SatBrowserTleDataLoader) into a function that reads and populates data into list model and makes hash... and if needed takes in "pregress bar and updates it"



------------------
x Add Ground Location Window type -- used to predict satellite passes for a given ground location -- maybe right click 2D window to start this with locations lat/long - in menu
- Add Ephemeris STK format exporter tool
x show sun footprint (day/light) maybe even blend night lights?
- add ability to edit custom tle file from within app (just a text area to save /load file) (or custom sat where you can paste in a TLE)
x add land masses
x add options for land masses (if files exist, list options based on files in dir) - check for case of web start), 
x fix maps availible by list of files in dir??(will this work in JAR?/outside JAR - or use defaults plus ones in dir?)
- add option for no image background, or images in data/2dmaps dir
x change sat list - make JTreeTable -- list for geo-locations (facilities)


------------------
x add 3D windows
- Jtable in Sat list -- show TLE age??  Or other info? (maybe)
x movie catpure 9use jmi or jni)


-----------------
x Window with view from groud station of sat passing (showing North/S/E/W directions)
x TCP/IP interface control / get data in/out


----------------
xInegrate with Shawn's Sat Sim -- ability to creat own satellites, giving ini Pos/Vel 
 or Keplarian elements, Hprop, 2-body, etc.  


-----------------
x Add mission desginer like astrogator, with solver, and optimizer
